			<p class="movieDetail">Kalki 2898 AD is a 2024 Indian science fiction film about a group trying to save the unborn child of lab subject SUM-80, who is believed to be the tenth avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu, Kalki. The movie is set in a post-apocalyptic world in the year 2898 AD, where a towering inverted pyramid structure called the Complex is the only place that can support life. The Complex is ruled by the cyborg despot Supreme Yaskin (Kamal Haasan), and bounty hunter Bhairava (Prabhas) is tasked with capturing SUM-80 with the help of his AI droid sidekick Bujji (Keerthy Suresh). However, Ashwatthama (Amitabh Bachchan) must also protect SUM-80 at all costs, as he is cursed to wander the earth for eternity unless he does so. The movie also features a prologue set in 3102 BC after the Kurukshetra War from The Mahabharata.</p>
